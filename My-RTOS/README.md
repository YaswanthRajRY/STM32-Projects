# My-RTOS

## Overview
"My-RTOS" is a custom Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) developed for the STM32F401xC microcontroller using C and Assembly. This project focuses on implementing core RTOS concepts such as task scheduling, inter-task communication, mutexes, semaphores, priority inheritance, and more. It serves as a hands-on learning platform for understanding how embedded systems and real-time tasks operate at a low level.

## Key Features
- **Task Scheduler**: Implemented preemptive priority-based scheduling.
- **Mutex & Semaphores**: For task synchronization and resource management.
- **Inter-task Communication**: Queue and message passing between tasks.
- **Task Control Blocks (TCB)**: For managing task states and context switching.
- **Priority Inheritance**: To prevent priority inversion in task management.

## Skills & Technologies
- Embedded Systems development in **C** and **Assembly** for STM32F401xC.
- Deep understanding of **RTOS concepts** such as scheduling, synchronization, and memory management.
- Developing **low-level drivers** and handling hardware directly without HAL.

## Goals & Learning
This project allows me to:
- Gain a better understanding of RTOS internals and real-time scheduling.
- Experiment with task management and communication in embedded systems.
- Improve debugging and optimization skills for real-time applications.

## Conclusion
Building "My-RTOS" is helping me advance my knowledge in RTOS design, embedded programming, and system-level development, while also strengthening my passion for embedded systems and real-time systems.
